## Summary
I wrote my first programm in school on Liberty Basic. It could play .wav files and display images. Since then I didn't write any programs but I still remember some basics. I have already learned some aspects of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and hope to better my knowledge during this course.

 var col1;
 var col2;
 var counter2 = 0;

function f(h) {
counter++;
counter2++;
col1 = col[counter2-1];
col2 = col[7-counter2]
console.log(h);
h.innerHTML = "Вы нажали на кнопку: " + counter + " раз.";
h.style.background = col1;
h.style.color = col2;

if (counter2 == 7)
counter2 = 0;
};
